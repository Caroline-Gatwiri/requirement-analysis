# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## üìå Introduction

This repository focuses on **Requirement Analysis**, a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Using the context of a **Booking Management System**, it outlines the process of gathering, analyzing, and documenting system requirements to ensure successful delivery and stakeholder satisfaction.

## 1. What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It acts as a communication bridge between stakeholders and developers, ensuring the end product aligns with business goals.

Requirement Analysis typically occurs during the planning phase of the SDLC and sets the foundation for system design, development, and testing.

## 2. Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- ‚úÖ **Clarity and Understanding**  
  It ensures all stakeholders and developers have a shared understanding of system expectations, reducing ambiguity and miscommunication.

- ‚úÖ **Scope Definition**  
  Helps in clearly outlining the project boundaries, preventing scope creep and ensuring project focus.

- ‚úÖ **Cost and Time Estimation**  
  Provides the necessary information to accurately estimate development costs, timelines, and resource requirements.

- ‚úÖ **Quality Assurance**  
  Well-defined requirements increase the chances that the final product meets business needs and quality standards.

## 3. Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- üîç **Requirement Gathering**  
  Techniques include interviews, surveys, workshops, and document reviews to collect stakeholder needs.

- ‚úçÔ∏è **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Involves refining and clarifying requirements through brainstorming, focus groups, and prototyping.

- üìö **Requirement Documentation**  
  Creation of structured documents like Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), user stories, and use cases.

- üìä **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Prioritizing and evaluating requirements, and using diagrams or models (like ERDs or data flow diagrams) for deeper understanding.

- ‚úÖ **Requirement Validation**  
  Reviewing and confirming requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy, completeness, and feasibility.

## 4. Types of Requirements

### üîß Functional Requirements

These define what the system should do.

**Examples for a Booking Management System:**
- Users can **search** properties by location, price, and availability.
- Users can **register** and **log in** securely.
- The system allows **property booking**, **viewing booking history**, and **canceling bookings**.
- Admin can **manage listings** and view bookings.

### üõ°Ô∏è Non-functional Requirements

These define how the system performs its functions.

**Examples:**
- **Performance**: Pages should load in under 2 seconds with up to 1000 concurrent users.
- **Security**: All data must be encrypted and protected from unauthorized access.
- **Scalability**: The platform should support growing user numbers without a major redesign.
- **Usability**: Intuitive UI with mobile-first design principles.
- **Reliability**: System uptime of 99.9% with backup and recovery mechanisms.

## 5. Use Case Diagrams

**Use Case Diagrams** visually represent how users (actors) interact with the system to achieve specific goals.

### Benefits:
- Provide a clear, visual overview of system functionality.
- Help identify user roles and their actions.
- Enhance communication between stakeholders and developers.

### Actors:
- Guest User
- Registered User
- Admin

### Use Cases:
- Search Properties
- Register/Login
- Book Property
- View/Cancel Booking
- Manage Listings (Admin)

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

**Acceptance Criteria** are specific conditions a software feature must meet to be accepted by stakeholders.

### Why They Matter:
- Provide a measurable standard to verify feature completeness.
- Align expectations between stakeholders and developers.
- Act as a reference for testing and validation.

### Example: Checkout Feature (Booking System)
