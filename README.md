# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

Welcome to the **Requirement Analysis** project repository!

This repository is dedicated to documenting and demonstrating the key concepts, processes, and deliverables involved in the **Requirement Analysis phase** of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

The goal is to simulate a real-world scenario of planning a **Booking Management System**, where we identify and define both functional and non-functional requirements, create visual representations such as use case diagrams, and establish clear acceptance criteria. 

By the end of this project, you will gain hands-on experience with:
- Writing structured requirement documentation
- Differentiating between various requirement types
- Using visual tools to present requirements effectively
- Applying industry-standard best practices for successful project execution

This repository will serve as a practical reference for mastering the foundations of project planning and system requirements in software development.
